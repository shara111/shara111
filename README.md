Currently in my third year of a Bachelor of Software Development program, I am enthusiastically diving deep into the world of coding and technology.

I enjoy reading books, weight-training, and running. 

My professional experiences and extracurriculars cover many different areas of tech.

ðŸŒŸ What Drives Me:
A relentless curiosity about how technology can solve real-world problems, and making an impact.

Iâ€™m seeking a Summer 2025 Internship.
