Fourth-year Software Development student at Seneca Polytechnic. I'm driven by a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems and building something from scratch.



My journey spans hands-on experience with full-stack development, Product Design, cloud infrastructure, and collaborative team projects. When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually reading, lifting weights, running, or listening to music.
